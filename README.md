North Coders news Application

## Background 

This is a demonstration of a front end Application, A little bit like reddit, allowing users to post articles in specific topics, as well as allowing them to comment, delete their comments, upvote different users comments, browse online users, upvote and downvote articles and sort users articles by date, user or topic!

During the build process for this project, I learnt how to use the React.js framework, with CSS/HTML, plus a few node packages for icons and fonts, as well as using Axios to call my API, that was built with and tested with multiple endpoints that can be seen in my github page. 

My database is handles by PSQL, and interaction will be dealth with using Knex.

The app is hosted with heroku.
